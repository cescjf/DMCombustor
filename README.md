# DMCombustor
One dimensional method that simulates dual-mode Scramjet isolator-combustor in Fortran
In the codes, such as Area changes, Multi-injection, gamma changes, Boundary layer, etc., were included, then a more realistic property values were calculated from the entrance of isolator to the exit of combustor.
